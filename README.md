# Data Science Projects

Welcome to the **Data Science Projects Repository**! 🚀

This repository serves as a collection of various data science projects, covering different domains, methodologies, and techniques. Each project includes datasets, analysis scripts, and Jupyter Notebooks that walk through the data exploration, processing, modeling, and insights extraction process.

## 📊 Projects

🔍 **[Blood Sugar](Blood_Sugar/)**
<p align=justify>
This project aims to develop a predictive model for early diabetes detection using diagnostic data from Pima Indian women. The dataset includes key medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, and insulin, which help identify potential diabetes cases. The challenge involves analyzing influential factors, visualizing data patterns, and estimating diabetes risk based on specific patient attributes.
