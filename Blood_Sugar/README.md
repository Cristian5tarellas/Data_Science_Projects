## ðŸ“– Background

Diabetes mellitus remains a global health issue, causing several thousand people to die each day from this single condition. Finding and avoiding diabetes in the earlier stages can help reduce the risk of serious health issues such as circulatory system diseases, kidney malfunction, and vision loss. This competition involves developing a predictive model for effectively detecting potential Diabetes cases, ideally, before commencing preventive treatment.

## ðŸ’¾ The data

The dataset contains diagnostic measurements that are associated with diabetes, which were collected from a population of Pima Indian women. The data includes various medical and demographic attributes, making it a well-rounded resource for predictive modeling.

The columns and Data Types are as follows:

- Pregnancies
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.

- Glucose
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

- BloodPressure
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

- SkinThickness
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).

- Insulin
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

- BMI
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).

- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

- Age
Type: Numerical (Continuous)
Description: Age of the patient in years.

- Outcome
Type: Categorical (Binary)
Description: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. 1 = Yes, 0 = No.

## ðŸ’ª Competition challenge

In this challenge, you will focus on the following key tasks:

- Determine the most important factors affecting the diabetes outcome.
- Create interactive plots to visualize the relationship between diabetes and the determined factors from the previous step.
- What's the risk of a person of Age 54, length 178 cm and weight 96 kg, and Glucose levels of 125 mg/dL getting diabetes?
